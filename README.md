# Advent of Code 2022
## Day 1:
+ For the first part we summed up every elf calorie count and pushed it to an array. From there we just found the max value of that array.
+ For the second part after finding max value of the total calorie array, we just remove it from the array and repeat 3 times. From there we just sum up those 3 values and we get our answer.
## Day 2:
+ For the first part all we had to do is check for all cases and accumulate total points.
+ For the second part it's exactly the same thing just different point count in each case.
## Day 3:
+ For the first part first we had to divide every single rucksack into two list of halves. From there we had to iterate over every character of the word and find corresponding priority score number.
+ For the second part we just check first three rucksacks in our list, find the matching badge, add the score and break the iteration and move on to next pair of three. Simpler than part one!
## Day 4:
+ For the first part divide the pairs into two halves. After that just check if both pairs contain each other and accumulate total
+ For the second part divide the pairs into two halves again. After that make helper list and push range of numbers to them. Check if any of the helper list contains any overlapping number,accumulate the total and empty the helper list on end of iteration.
